Credit for all the hard maths go to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n\r\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (1.7.2 or greater is recommended)\r\n- A device running iOS or the iPhone Simulator\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\n\t$( window ).swipe({\r\n\t\tleft: function() {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log( \"You swiped left!\" );\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tright: function() {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log( \"You swiped right!\" );\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tthreshold: {\r\n\t\t\tx: 200,\r\n\t\t\ty: 50\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n### Parameters ###\r\n\r\n- `left`: A function you'd like to execute when a left swipe is detected. Defaults to `function( event ) {}`.\r\n- `right`: A function you'd like to execute when a right swipe is detected. Defaults to `function( event ) {}`.\r\n- `threshold`: An object containing an `x` and `y` value. The threshold is used to determine what constitues a swipe. The implied unite is pixels and the default threshold is `{ x: 100, y: 25 }`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n\r\n- Add support for callbacks\r\n- Improve event handling\r\n- Figure out what the heck touchCancel is","tagline":"A jQuery plugin for binding actions to left and right swipe events in Mobile Safari (or any browser that supports onTouchStart, onTouchEnd, onTouchMove, and onTouchCancel events).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
